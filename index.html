          <div>Who is your tutor / instructor</div>
          <div> My current tutor/ instructor is Dr.Nguyen Minh Long</div>

          <div>Who is your labber</div>
          <div>My labber is also Dr.Nguyen Minh Long</div>

          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Yes, I think that I have a little knowledge in programming and web design since I have participated in Intro to IT as well as Intro to programming. I have created my own website using online template and hosted it by using Github in order to finish my assignment/assesment in Intro to IT. About my experience in programming, I have learnt about Python and coding it using Pycharm to make different interesting things. In the conclusion, I think I have some experience in programming and web design due to my previous IT courses.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>In my opinion, I see myself as a programmer since I find coding and testing codes are extremely fun and interesting to me. I love to code as well as figuring out better, faster codes for my program and see how it works. On the opposite side, designing is not my strength, I am a picky person which gives me hard time to choose anything especially colors, designs. Not only that, I have poor skills in Art or any kinds of decorating and designing. Because of that, designing if extremely difficult for me and also time-consuming since it will definitely take ages for me to choose a specific design and color that fit. In the end, I only see myself as a programmer because I like to code/programming but not a designer. </div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>This is my second semester studying IT in RMIT. In my first semester, I got to interact with coding, including HTML and Python. These 2 programming languages are very interesting to me and I want to study more about it. Because of that, I have enrolled in Web Programming and also Practical Database Concept in order to have deeper knowledge about HTML, Python and controlling databases. Later on, I will be studying Programming 1 so that my programming skills will significantly improve and it will help me in the future. </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>This course is all about web programming so what I hope to get out of the course is knowledge about creating a website using many different tools and also design the layout of the website. Nowadays, website are one of the most things that people use everyday and it is a great tool for humanity. So in order to understand and be able to design a website effectively, I must study and acknowledge how website work and that is also what I want to get out of this course.</div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>Personally, I prefer working individually on my assignment but since some assignment are allowed to have more than 2 people, I am fine with working with many different people. About my strength, I think that I am pretty good at working on what I'm assigned to and I considered myself as a hard-working student. More than that, I can come up with creative, interesting ideas that could definitely help everyone in the assignment and I also look for online resources that may help my team to improve the quality of the project. On the other side, I don't require my teammates to be super talented or someone who works 24/7, all I want from my teammates are they need to be hard-working and understand what they are doing. </div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div> Websites that I use the most are: Google, Facebook and Youtube.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I have plenty of interests and hobbies. One of them is playing video games, I love playing online video games with my friends, we got to talk and play the game with each other. Another hobby of mine is badminton, I used to participate in badminton tournaments and won a few time back when I was in highschool, nowadays, I don't have much time to play it and also because of the Virus. The last interesting thing about me is I am a huge dog lover, I find dogs to be extremely adorable and friendly. I do have a dog, she is a Corgi named Candy, she is very cute and active. I think that is all about my hobbies, interests.Thank you for reading! </div>
